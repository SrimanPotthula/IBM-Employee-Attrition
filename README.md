# IBM Employee Attrition Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing IBM's HR dataset to understand the key factors contributing to employee attrition. 
The goal is to extract useful insights that can help in improving employee retention and satisfaction.

## About the Dataset
The dataset includes various employee details such as age, department, job role, education, environment satisfaction, income, work-life balance, and whether the employee has left the company (attrition).

## Objectives
- Explore the data and understand patterns related to employee attrition
- Find out which features (like job satisfaction, overtime, income, etc.) influence attrition the most
- Visualize key trends using graphs and charts

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## What I Did
- Cleaned and explored the data
- Used visualizations to compare attrition vs. various features
- Found meaningful patterns that can be useful for HR teams

## Key Takeaways
- Employees with low job satisfaction or high overtime hours are more likely to leave
- Attrition rates are higher among younger employees and in certain departments
- Work-life balance and income also play a significant role in employee retention
